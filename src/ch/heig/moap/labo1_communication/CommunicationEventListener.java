/**
 * This interface is given as an example; when building up an asynchronous
 * interface using event listeners, one has to define a specific event listener deriving
 * from the basic EventListener interface (see java.util).
 * 
 * Contract : The interface proposed here returns a boolean indicating TRUE if the
 * handler has completely processed the event sent (thus, other handlers would not be
 * invoked). If the handler instance returns FALSE, then subsequent handlers (if
 * existing) will be invoked with the same argument.
